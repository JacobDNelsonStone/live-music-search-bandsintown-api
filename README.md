# Live Event Search Ticket Master API
## About
This is our repo for group project 1, a web app powered by third-party-APIs. Initially, we had requested an API key from Bands In Town, but did not recieve word in time and switched to using Serp API for Google Events. This, too, was an issue as Serp API only wants their keys to be used server-side. For our application, we created an event search engine using tickemaster's API. This application utilizes HTML, CSS, Javascript, Bootstrap, JQuery, and Dayjs over the two pages. Users can search events by city and date, and save events they are interested in.
